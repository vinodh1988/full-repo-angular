Pipes is an angular feature 
   
   that is usually used in the template within the interpolation
   expression

   it is applied on a target variable which is either scalar
   or a collection

   angular offers inbuilt pipes that can be applied on scalar variables
   only

   for applying on arrays you need to define your own pipes

   Generally
   
   pipe if applied on scalar target it formats the target

   {{name | uppercase }} - converts the name into uppercase
   {{price | currency:'USD'}} - prints price as $350.00 if price is 350

   in the aboves cases you could see a pipe expression has three parts

   1. target variable
   2. pipe name
   3. parameters [optional
   
   pipe if applied on array target usually it filters the target
   , we have to define our own pipe to apply on arrays
